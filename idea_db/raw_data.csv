n8n_1753605344706_auc9jtp0j,n8n,ü§ñ Build an Interactive AI Agent with Chat Interface and Multiple Tools,"How it works

This template is a complete, hands-on tutorial that lets you build and interact with your very first AI Agent.

Think of an AI Agent as a standard AI chatbot with superpowers. The agent doesn't just talk; it can use tools to perform actions and find information in real-time. This workflow is designed to show you exactly how that works.

The Chat Interface (Chat Trigger): This is your window to the agent. It's a fully styled, public-facing chat window where you can have a conversation.
The Brain (AI Agent Node): This is the core of the operation. It takes your message, understands your intent, and intelligently decides which ""superpower"" (or tool) it needs to use to answer your request. The agent's personality and instructions are defined in its extensive system prompt.
The Tools (Tool Nodes): These are the agent's superpowers. We've included a variety of useful and fun tools to showcase its capabilities:
    Get a random joke.
    Search Wikipedia for a summary of any topic.
    Calculate a future date.
    Generate a secure password.
    Calculate a monthly loan payment.
    Fetch the latest articles from the n8n blog.
The Memory (Memory Node): This gives the agent a short-term memory, allowing it to remember the last few messages in your conversation for better context.


When you send a message, the agent's brain analyzes it, picks the right tool for the job, executes it, and then formulates a helpful response based on the tool's output.

Set up steps

Setup time: ~3 minutes

This template is nearly ready to go out of the box. You just need to provide the AI's ""brain.""

Configure Credentials: This workflow requires an API key for an AI model. Make sure you have credentials set up in your n8n instance for either Google AI (Gemini) or OpenAI.
Choose Your AI Brain (LLM):
    By default, the workflow uses the Google Gemini node. If you have Google AI credentials, you're all set!
    If you prefer to use OpenAI, simply disable the Gemini node and enable the OpenAI node. You only need one active LLM node. Make sure it is connected to the Agent parent node.
Explore the Tools: Take a moment to look at the different tool nodes connected to the Your First AI Agent node. This is where the agent gets its abilities! You can add, remove, or modify these to create your own custom agent.
Activate and Test!
    Activate the workflow.
    Open the public URL for the Example Chat Window node (you can copy it from the node's panel).
    Start chatting! Try asking it things like:
        ""Tell me a joke.""
        ""What is n8n?""
        ""Generate a 16-character password for me.""
        ""What are the latest posts on the n8n blog?""
        ""What is the monthly payment for a $300,000 loan at 5% interest over 30 years?""","n8n,workflow,automation",Automation,https://n8n.io/workflows/5819/,2025-07-27,TRUE
n8n_1753605344706_cxb6airwo,n8n,ü§ñ Build a Documentation Expert Chatbot with Gemini RAG Pipeline,"How it works

This template is a complete, hands-on tutorial for building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. In simple terms, you'll teach an AI to become an expert on a specific topic‚Äîin this case, the official n8n documentation‚Äîand then build a chatbot to ask it questions.

Think of it like this: instead of a general-knowledge AI, you're building an expert librarian.

The workflow is split into two main parts:

Part 1: Indexing the Knowledge (Building the Library)
    This is a one-time process you run manually. The workflow automatically scrapes all pages of the n8n documentation, breaks them down into small, digestible chunks, and uses an AI model to create a special numerical representation (an ""embedding"") for each chunk. These embeddings are then stored in n8n's built-in Simple Vector Store. This is like a librarian reading every book and creating a hyper-detailed index card for every paragraph.

    Important: This in-memory knowledge base is temporary. It will be erased if you restart your n8n instance, and you will need to run the indexing process again.

Part 2: The AI Agent (The Expert Librarian)
    This is the chat interface. When you ask a question, the AI agent doesn't guess the answer. Instead, it uses your question to find the most relevant ""index cards"" (chunks) from the knowledge base it just built. It then feeds these specific, relevant chunks to a powerful language model (Gemini) with a strict instruction: ""Answer the user's question using ONLY this information."" This ensures the answers are accurate, factual, and grounded in your provided documents.

Set up steps

Setup time: 2 minutes (plus 15-20 minutes for indexing)

This template uses n8n's built-in tools, removing the need for an external database. Follow these simple steps to get started.

Configure Google AI Credentials:
    You will need a Google AI API key for the Gemini models.
    In your n8n workflow, go to any of the three Gemini nodes (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash).
    Click the Credential dropdown and select + Create New Credential.
    Enter your Gemini API key and save.

Apply Credentials to All Nodes:
    Your new Google AI credential is now saved. Go to the other two Gemini nodes (Gemini Chunk Embedding and Gemini Query Embedding) and select your newly created credential from the dropdown list.

Build the Knowledge Base:
    Find the Start Indexing manual trigger node at the top-left of the workflow.
    Click its ""Execute workflow"" button to start the indexing process.
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Be Patient: This will take 15-20 minutes as it scrapes and processes the entire n8n documentation. You only need to do this once per n8n session. If you restart n8n, you must run this step again.

Chat with Your Expert Agent:
    Once the indexing is complete, Activate the entire workflow using the toggle at the top of the screen.
    Open the RAG Chatbot chat trigger node (bottom-left) and copy its Public URL.
    Open the URL in a new tab and start asking questions about n8n! For example: ""How does the IF node work?"" or ""What is a sub-workflow?"".","n8n,workflow,automation",Automation,https://n8n.io/workflows/6137/,2025-07-27,TRUE

   The ""Wait 60 sec."" node pauses execution for 60 seconds.  
   The ""Get status"" node checks the video generation status. If the status is ""COMPLETED,"" the workflow proceeds; otherwise, it waits again.  
Video Processing:  
   The ""Get Url Video"" node fetches the video URL.  
   The ""Generate title"" node uses OpenAI (GPT-4.1) to create an SEO-optimized YouTube and TikTok title.  
   The ""Get File Video"" node downloads the video file.  
Upload & Update:  
   The ""Upload Video"" node saves the video to Google Drive.  
   The ""HTTP Request"" node uploads the video to YouTube via the Upload-Post API.  
   The ""HTTP Request"" node uploads the video to TikTok via the Upload-Post API.  
   The ""Update Youtube URL"" and ""Update result"" nodes update the Google Sheet with the video URL and YouTube link.  

Set Up Steps  
Google Sheet Setup:  
   Create a Google Sheet with columns: PROMPT, DURATION, VIDEO, and YOUTUBE_URL.  
   Share the Sheet link in the ""Get new video"" node.  

API Keys:  
   Obtain a Fal.run API key (for Veo3) and set it in the ""Create Video"" node (Header: Authorization: Key YOURAPIKEY).  
   Get an Upload-Post API key (for YouTube uploads) and configure the ""HTTP Request"" node (Header: Authorization: Apikey YOUR_API_KEY).  
   Get an Upload-Post API key (for TikTok uploads) and configure the ""HTTP Request"" node (Header: Authorization: Apikey YOUR_API_KEY).  

YouTube Upload Configuration:  
   Replace YOUR_USERNAME in the ""HTTP Request"" node with your Upload-Post profile name.  

Schedule Trigger:  
   Configure the ""Schedule Trigger"" node to run periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes).
